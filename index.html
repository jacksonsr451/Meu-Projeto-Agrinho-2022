    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>

    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong></p>
    <p><em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p> 
    <p><strong>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, <em>remaining essentially unchanged</em>.</strong></p>
